Travel-Plan
Objectives

The primary goal of this project is to construct a robust and scalable environment for the Travel Management System and to develop a comprehensive Admin Dashboard that serves as the control center for travel management operations.
Instructions

This is the first part of the last project and for this part, the students will be asked to build the working environment and implement the admin part to ease the last part of the project.
1. Environment Configuration
Configure a Microservices Architecture:

    Follow industry best practices for scalability and high availability.
    Implement multiple replicas of each microservice for load balancing and failover mechanisms.

Database Installation and Configuration:

    Set up PostgreSQL and Neo4j databases.
    Ensure databases are containerized to facilitate scalability and replication.

Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) Pipeline:

    Employ Jenkins for CI/CD and unit testing.
    Employ SonarQube to automate code quality checks

Use of Docker and Ansible:

    Docker to support automated provisioning and deployment of microservices.
    Ansible for creating playbooks to deploy all system elements consistently and in a scalable way.

Logging

    Implement some sort of logging system to be able to track and trace requests across multiple services.

Outcome:

    Achieve an automated, scalable infrastructure.
    Prepare the groundwork for Admin Dashboard development and additional features of the Travel Management System.

2. Development and Design

    Craft an Admin Dashboard enabling administrators to oversee users, travels, and payment gateways.
    The admin should be able to add, edit or delete any user, travel, payment method and all the related parts correctly (think about database cascading update and delete).
    Ensure each travel entry includes a destination or multiple destinations, dates, duration, activities, accommodation, and transportation details.
    For the payment methods you can search about it to know what you need to do to support at least Stripe and PayPal.
    Develop an authentication and authorization service to safeguard access and operations to the Admin Dashboard.
    Design a responsive and intuitive UI for the Admin Dashboard that shows well in different screen sizes, ensuring browser compatibility at least for Mozilla and Chrome.
    Utilize any beneficial packages to enhance development efficiency, with the expectation to justify package selections during project reviews.
    Every feature should have its unit tests to ensure the new modifications don't break the code.

3. Best Practices & Ecosystem Familiarity

    Adopt a collaborative development workflow using pull requests (PRs) for introducing changes and features.
    Perform thorough code reviews on each PR to maintain code integrity, security adherence, and best practice compliance.
    Integrate a CI/CD pipeline via Jenkins for seamless build, test, and deployment workflows of PRs.
    Ensure all PRs undergo a rigorous review process, securing approval before merging into the main codebase.

4. Security Measures

    Implement SSL/TLS encryption for all data in transit.
    Ensure databases and services are accessible only within the internal network or via secure, authenticated endpoints.
    Use secret management tools like HashiCorp Vault to handle sensitive information like API keys and database credentials.
    Apply the principle of least privilege across all levels of the system, particularly in role-based access controls within the Admin Dashboard.
    Regularly update all components to patch known vulnerabilities and ensure compliance with security best practices.

Bonus

    Compose clear and detailed documentation for the application and database schema.
    Incorporate Kubernetes alongside Ansible to enhance service management, orchestration, and load-balancing capabilities.
    Implement integration and/or E2E tests
    Any other bonus that adds real value to the project.





Let's Travel
Objectives

This phase aims to enhance the Travel Management System by integrating key features that focus on engaging travelers, offering personalized travel recommendations, and ensuring secure transactions. It highlights specific functionalities for Admins, Travel Managers, and Travelers, providing a tailored experience for each role.
Instructions

Expand the Travel Management System by incorporating essential features and defining clear roles and responsibilities. Ensure each role is granted access to functionalities relevant to their needs, with Admins and Travel Managers having additional privileges for comprehensive system management.
1. Feature Development and Integration by Roles
Admin:

    View top-ranking managers and travels, including reports on income for the last months and the number of organized travels.
    Access a detailed travel history list and feedbacks to assess user satisfaction.
    See a list of managers ordered based on their performance score, taking into account travel feedbacks, income, and other relevant metrics.
    Include a section for admins to review reports filed by travelers against travels or managers.
    Have the ability to perform all actions available to Travel Managers and Travelers, ensuring full oversight of the system.

Travel Manager:

    Create and manage personal travel offerings, with the capability to view feedback specific to their organized travels.
    Access a dashboard that displays key statistics linked to their travels, such as income, number of trips, and number of travelers.
    Manage subscriber lists for each travel, with options to view profiles or unsubscribe travelers from the travel.
    Have access to all functionalities available to a Traveler, enhancing their understanding of the user experience.
    Utilize detailed analytics and feedback to inform future travel planning and management strategies.

Traveler:

    Integrate an Elasticsearch-based travel search with autocomplete for smooth, dynamic querying across all travel details, ensuring swift and accurate results.
    Browse available travels and receive personalized suggestions based on previous feedback and participation (use at least 3 fields of the travel), utilizing Neo4j for customization.
    Subscribe and unsubscribe from travels with a cutoff period of 3 days before the travel start date for flexibility.
    Execute payments for subscriptions using various methods, catering to user convenience and security.
    Provide feedback on participated travels, contributing to the community's overall quality and trustworthiness.
    Access a Travel Manager page to view statistics, past travel ratings, and the number of reports, fostering transparency and accountability.
    Report Travel Managers or other travelers, ensuring a safe and respectful community environment.
    View personal statistics, including past travel participation, report counts, subscription cancellations, and preferred payment methods, for a personalized experience.

2. Responsive and Intuitive UI

Design a user interface that is responsive, intuitive, and accessible across various devices and browsers. Ensure seamless user experience from search to booking, with efficient navigation and relevant information presentation.
3. Testing and Quality Assurance

    Develop comprehensive unit, integration, and end-to-end tests for all new features.
    Employ continuous integration practices to automate testing and ensure code quality throughout the development process.

4. Security and Compliance

    Implement robust security measures to protect traveler data and transaction details, with a focus on authentication, payment processing, and privacy.
    Adhere to legal standards and industry best practices for data protection and online transactions, ensuring compliance and user trust.
    Ensure secure data transmission with SSL/TLS protocols.
